# Fintech
 A full-stack web application that helps users track and manage bills

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
SplitEase solves two critical pain points:  
1. **Bill-Splitting Hassles**: Splits group bills fairly via equal, percentage, or item-wise splits, with UPI payment reminders. 
2. **Budgeting Blindness**: Automatically categorizes expenses (food, clothes, medicine, etc.) and enforces spending limits. (Work in progress)
